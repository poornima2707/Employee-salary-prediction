# üß† Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether an individual earns more than $50K per year using machine learning techniques on census income data. It involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and deployment through an interactive web app.

## üìå Project Overview

The primary goal is to build a classification model that can determine an employee's income bracket (`<=50K` or `>50K`) based on features like age, education, occupation, and work hours. The project walks through the complete data science workflow ‚Äî from raw data to deployment.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description

This dataset contains demographic and employment-related information for individuals, used to classify whether a person earns more than $50K/year. It originates from the U.S. Census database and is provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income).

| **Column Name**     | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `age`               | Age of the individual (numeric)                                                 |
| `workclass`         | Type of employment (e.g., Private, Self-employed, Government, etc.)             |
| `fnlwgt`            | Final weight ‚Äì represents the number of people the record represents            |
| `education`         | Highest level of education completed (e.g., HS-grad, Bachelors)                 |
| `education-num`     | Education level in numeric form (e.g., 11 = 11th grade)                          |
| `marital-status`    | Marital status (e.g., Never-married, Married-civ-spouse)                        |
| `occupation`        | Type of job (e.g., Sales, Exec-managerial, Machine-op-inspct)                   |
| `relationship`      | Relationship within the household (e.g., Husband, Own-child, Unmarried)         |
| `race`              | Race of the individual (e.g., White, Black, Asian-Pac-Islander)                 |
| `gender`            | Gender of the individual (Male or Female)                                       |
| `capital-gain`      | Capital gains in dollars                                                        |
| `capital-loss`      | Capital loss in dollars                                                         |
| `hours-per-week`    | Number of hours worked per week                                                 |
| `native-country`    | Country of origin (e.g., United-States, India, Mexico)                          |
| `income`            | **Target label** ‚Äì income class (`<=50K` or `>50K`)                             |

## üîß Key Steps & Techniques

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values (`?`) by replacing with `"Others"`, removed invalid rows.
- **Outlier Removal**: Filtered out extreme values for `age`, `educational-num`, and `capital-gain`.
- **Label Encoding**: Converted categorical features into numerical form using `LabelEncoder`.
- **Feature Selection**: Dropped redundant columns like `education` in favor of `educational-num`.
- **Model Building**: Applied multiple classifiers using scikit-learn.

## ü§ñ Models Trained

| Model                | Accuracy |
|---------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 79.3%    |
| Random Forest       | 85.2%    |
| KNN                 | 77.0%    |
| SVM                 | 78.8%    |
| Gradient Boosting   | **85.7%** ‚úÖ |

‚úÖ **Gradient Boosting** was selected as the final model.

## üöÄ Deployment (Streamlit)

A simple web application was created using **Streamlit**, enabling:
- Real-time prediction based on manual inputs
- Batch prediction from uploaded CSV files
- Downloading prediction results

The best-performing model was saved using `joblib` as `best_model.pkl`.
